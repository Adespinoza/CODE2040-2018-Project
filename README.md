# Visualizing Potter, An Exploration of Harry Potter Through Data Visualization
By [Alexis Herrera](https://github.com/alexisherrera)

## Overview
This web-application is for the **Code2040 Fellowship** and explores two Harry Potter datasets through data visualization, basic statistical techniques, and natural language processing (through APIs).

[**Check it out here!**](https://code2040-samples-pr-17.herokuapp.com/)

## Technicalities
I organized this code sample through a collection of **6 modules**, where I analyze a particular aspect/characteristic of the data provided. For instance, in one module I analyze the frequency of spells per books in the dataset and in another I analyze the sentiment of the effects/definition for each spell using the [Google NLP API](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/).

My backend work was done in **Ruby/Rails**. This is where I make all my API calls and organize my data in JSON formats. On the front-end, I used regular **HTML/CSS/JS** with the help of [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/).

##  Learnings
Prior to this, I had never really worked with Ruby/Rails, so I picked up a lot of what I used for this project on the spot. While I found it a little confusing at the start, after reading through the documentation and experimenting with the boilerplate code provided, I have come to appreciate it. It is actually really easy to get an app running with the Rails framework.

This was also the first time that I utilized the [Google NLP API](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/) to retrieve the sentiment analysis of text. That was really cool to explore and is something that I will try to learn about at a deeper level. Overall, working through this code sample was a really fun and educational experience.

## Future Directions
Something that I think would be cool to add to this code sample would be more interactive data visualizations, perhaps through D3.js. **If anyone has any other suggestions please feel free to message me**!
